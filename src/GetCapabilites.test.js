// This code is a unit test for the GetCapabilities component, which is a React component. 
// The test checks if the component displays the correct layer names and abstracts.
// The render function from the @testing-library/react library is used to render the 
// component for testing. The screen object from the same library is used to get references 
// to elements in the component's DOM.The userEvent library is used to simulate user interactions
// with the component. In this case, the click function is called on a dropdown element obtained
// by calling getByRole with the argument 'combobox'.The findAllByRole function from the screen 
// object is used to get all option elements in the dropdown. The forEach method is then called on 
// the resulting array of options. For each option, the code checks if its value is not empty. If
//  the value is not empty, the code proceeds to extract the layer name from the option value.
// Then, a network request is made to fetch the capabilities of the WMS service, using the fetch
//  function with a specific URL. The response is then converted to text using the text() method. 
//  Next, a DOMParser is used to parse the XML text response into an XML document, 
//  which can be queried and processed.The test does not have any explicit assertions or 
//  checks on the result of the test. Instead, it appears that the test is meant to check 
//  that the code inside the loop does not throw any errors. However, the purpose of the test
//   is not entirely clear without more context or information on the expected behavior of the 
//   GetCapabilities component.
